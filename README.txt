Code style notes
============

This package mostly follows the Divmod Coding Standard:
	http://divmod.org/trac/wiki/CodingStandard
except:
-	Use hard tabs for indentation.
-	Use hard tabs only at the beginning of a line.
-	Prefer to have lines <= 80 characters, but always less than 100.
-	In docstrings, use epytext, but don't use @param, @type, etc.
	Few people know how to maintain those annotations.
